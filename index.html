      <h2>About Him</h2>
      <p>
        Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, born on 31 October 1875 in Gujarat, was one of India’s greatest leaders during and after the freedom struggle. Known as the <b>"Iron Man of India"</b>, he displayed remarkable determination, courage, and leadership throughout his life. Initially a successful lawyer, Patel was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi’s call for non-violent resistance and soon became a key figure in the Indian National Congress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Patel first rose to national fame through the Bardoli Satyagraha in 1928, where he led farmers in a successful protest against unfair British taxation. His fearless leadership during this movement earned him the title <b>“Sardar”</b>, meaning leader. Throughout the freedom struggle, Patel worked alongside Gandhi and other leaders, participating actively in movements like the <b>Salt March</b> and the <b>Quit India Movement</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        After independence, Patel became India’s <b>First Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister</b>. His greatest achievement was the peaceful integration of over 565 princely states into the Indian Union. Using a mix of diplomacy, persuasion, and firmness, he managed to unify the country without major conflict. This incredible task earned him immense respect and the nickname <b>“The Iron Man of India.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Patel also strengthened India’s civil services, helping to build the administrative backbone of the new nation. He passed away on 15 December 1950, but his legacy continues to inspire. In 2018, India honored him with the Statue of Unity, the tallest statue in the world, celebrating his role in shaping modern India.
